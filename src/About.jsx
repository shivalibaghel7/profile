      Hi, and Welcome to my Site! I am Shivali Baghel, a blogger, singer,
      writer, sportsperson, peripatetic, and a developer by profession. Born in
      1997, I feel lucky to have been a part of two centuries.{" "}
      <Icon name="smile outline"></Icon>. <br /> <br />
      Coming to my family, my father has always inculcated discipline and has
      taught to me to have a practical approach to life, whatsoever be the
      situation. My mother has left no stone unturned to teach me the life
      morals as well as made me emotionally strong and empathetic towards
      everthing. Oh yeah, there is another kid in my family (apart from me) who
      gets to learn something from me....My younger brother. He is not just
      strict with me but is my support and also my biggest critic. He is a
      blessing in my life as it was because of him that I got a privilege of
      being an elder sister which eventually made me responsible.
