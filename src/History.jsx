      I was born on 7 March 1997, in a small town in Bihar, India. But as my dad
      was posted in Mandovi, Goa at that time... I was carried to Goa when I was
      just a few weeks old. Most of my childhood was spent there until I was
      eligible to take admission in nursery. I completed my pre-school education
      in Bhopal. <br /> <br />
      The next two years, I studied in Andaman & Nicobar Islands. this is where
      I realized that I had some kind of affinity for water, when I accompanied
      my dad for diving. Also,I did my first Dance performance at the age of 6.
      In 2005, just before the major tsunami, we came back to Bhopal.
      <br /> <br />
      At the age of 9, we got posted to Mumbai and I did four years of my
      schooling from there. It was here that I started playing sports like
      squash, badminton and most importantly swimming. Swimming became the first
      activity that I learnt on my own and did a high jump from 7ft high board
      when I was just 10.
      <br /> <br />I pursued the rest of my Middle School education till Class
      XI from Bangalore. I was awarded the School Topper Award in Class X Boards
      for being among the only two students to score a 10.0 CGPA in CBSE Boards
      from our School. I started playing basketball and represented my House
      Colour in school. This is when I took the decision of taking Science (PCM)
      with Computer Science-Java, which helped me in shaping the rest of my
      future.
      <br /> <br />
      After completing my XI, we again changed city to the capital city- Delhi.
      I completed my Class XII from here, where I represented my school in a
      Symposium competition for the first time. I gave many of the entrance
      exams for admission to colleges including Manipal, SRM, UPES(Dehradun),
      BIT etc. I did clear most of them to get a seat in CSE in the main branch,
      but due to certain inevitable reasons had to stay back in Delhi to
      continue my Engineering. I finally joined Amity University, Noida and
      pursued Bachelor of technology in Computer Science and Engineering from
      there.
      <br /> <br />
      In the first two years of Engineering, I managed to make it to the
      college-level Basketball team. The next two years, I started preparing for
      Aptitude exams for In-campus Placements. Fearing that me being an
      introvert would not lead me to any company as Group Discussions would be a
      hurdle. My family helped me to come out of my shell and supported me in
      way which is inexplicable.
      <br /> <br />
      Not only did I clear the GDs (some having three GDs back to back, an hour
      long each ) and interviews with flying colours (with as much as being
      among the 30 students from India to have been placed in that company), I
      got three offers in my hand from big brands and also became the first
      student from Engineering to have been placed. Apart from that, I did many
      internships, one of them being Samsung which selected about 20 students
      from our college. During the end of my engineering, my parents got
      transferred to Bangalore, but this time I had to stay back for my last
      semester examinations. This was the first time, I had to stay alone and
      still managed to score a 9.8 GPA in my those exams. Finally, I completed
      my Engineering in the month of May 2019 with First Division with
      Distinction which was my aim.
      <br /> <br />I came to Bangalore and before I could cherish all the happy
      moments.. I recieved Joining letter from TCS within a week of landing in
      Bangalore. Again, for the first time I had to stay separate from my
      family, even after being in the same city. I joined TCS in June 2019 as an
      Assistant System Engineer Trainee and am currently working there.
